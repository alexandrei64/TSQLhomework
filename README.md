# TSQLhomework

## üìå Description

This repository holds homework assignments I completed during my T-SQL learning path.

Most home works rely on the AdventureWorks 2012 database offered for learning purposes by Microsoft. This is available to create on your local machine from [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver15&tabs=ssms).
